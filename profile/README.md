## Background

Our project started when one of our team member from psychology learned from his KKN experience that Indonesia has
huge untouched aromatherapy production potential due to lack of awareness from the community.

Aromatherapy has been traditionally used and produced in Indonesia to enhance wellbeing using essential oil products,
such as minyak kayu putih and diffusers. On top of that, the global aromatherapy and diffusers market is expected
to grow from 2023 to 2023.

Because of these, we are personally motivated to create a solution that utilizes aromatherapy to enhance wellbeing and
increase awareness regarding Indonesia’s aromatherapy potential.

AI is developing quickly and IoT smart homes are shifting towards wellness-enhancing devices.
Even then, we still haven’t found a product that combines AI, IoT, and aromatherapy.

From that gap, we introduce “Serena: Smart Home, Smart Wellbeing,”
a startup that aspires to solve the question:

> “How can IoT, AI, and aromatherapy harmonize to tailor each user’s experience of wellbeing?”

For this capstone, we prototyped SerenBox: a smart diffuser that can be configured based on the user’s emotions along with its companion app SerenApp.
Our product will be able to detect 7 emotions from the users photo and diffuse 2 essential oils
that best match the user’s current mood.

## Philosophy

![Serena Logo](<./profile/Serena Logo.jpeg>)

Our logo is a technological leaf, signifying our commitment to harmonizing nature and technology.
The leaf shape and soft teal colors represents our usage of aromatherapy and nature in our brand.
The leaf is modified by cyan circuits without breaking the leaf shape, signifying how we use modern technology
in aromatherapy without breaking its traditional roots and benefits. The leaf shape
is the most dominant shape since our main goal is to always prioritize nature and aromatherapy first, then enhancing it with AI and IoT.

## Results

You can see the explaination of our project in the video below:
[![Presentation Thumb](<./profile/Presentation Thumb.png>)](https://youtu.be/A52kqebpRqg)

We acquired 97.6% completion for our project's progress based on our plans. There were 2 features
we weren't able to implement in time: 1 in SerenApp due to our single mobile developer
having health problems near the end of capstone and 1 in SerenBox since our prototype got damaged during testing.
Nevertheless, considering the scope of our project and
our teams' capabilities still being students, we are very satisfied with the results.

There are 5 repositories in this GitHub organization which are all well-documented
for you to understand each part of our project:

1. [SerenBox](https://github.com/Serena-Smart-Home-Smart-Wellbeing/serena-serenbox)
2. [SerenApp](https://github.com/Serena-Smart-Home-Smart-Wellbeing/serena-serenapp)
3. [Serena Emotion Detector](https://github.com/Serena-Smart-Home-Smart-Wellbeing/serena-emotion-detector)
4. [Serena Backend](https://github.com/Serena-Smart-Home-Smart-Wellbeing/serena-backend)
5. [Serena GCP Infrastructure](https://github.com/Serena-Smart-Home-Smart-Wellbeing/serena-infrastructure)

## Future Plans

If our project is supported, we will be able to spearhead a new development in aromatherapy where
we will enhance and modernize it through IoT and AI. We will be able to create a new market
for AI powered smart home wellbeing-enhancing gadgets and innovate modern wellbeing
products that utilizes aromatherapy and other wellbeing practices.

Some ideas that we have for the future are:

1. SerenBox upgrades
   We'd like to upgrade our current SerenBox by attaching a camera directly to the device.
   We also want to run our model on the device itself so that it can be used offline and
   reduce latency. We'd also like to create a beautiful and ergonomic cover for the device. We
   also want to add other sensors to our device such as temperature and humidity sensors.
2. SerenApp upgrades
   We'd like to upgrade our SerenApp by having it available accross platforms (i.e. iOS, Android, and Web) to
   make it accessible to more users. We'd also like to upgrade the UX and UI of the app to make it more intuitive.
3. Serena Emotion Detector upgrades
   We'll prioritize upgrading our model's accuracy by detecting the user's emotions through
   other physiological signals such as heart rate and skin temperature.
   We'd like to upgrade our model by allowing it to detect emotions in real time.
   We'd also want to upgrade our model to detect emotions from multiple people at once. We'd also want to
   make our model runnable in our SerenBox device using TensorFlow Lite for microcontrollers.
4. Innovative Gadgets
   We'd want to innovate other wellbeing enhancing products that utilizes AI to adjust
   their configurations based on the user's current state. Some products we have in mind
   are smart air purifiers, smart speakers to blast out the best songs based on the users current mood,
   and a smart robot called SerBo that can adjust its responses based on the users current mood.
